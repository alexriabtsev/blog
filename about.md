A large number of participants around the world are now adding data on the terrain in which they live, helping to fill the map with information about the infrastructure of the infrastructure next to them, participating in the creation of a map for assistance to victims in areas of natural disasters, catastrophes, and so on.

The data collected by the project participants is free, open and free. They were obtained from open sources [transmitted by government and commercial organizations](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright#contributors), as well as collected during field studies by senior project participants.
