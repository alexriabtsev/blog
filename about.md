## Welcome to the Ukrainian community of OpenStreetMap!

[OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.

A large number of participants around the world are now adding data on the terrain in which they live, helping to fill the map with information about infrastructure objects next to them, participating in the creation of a map for assistance to victims in areas of natural disasters, catastrophes, and so on.

The data collected by the project participants is libre, open and free. They were obtained from open sources [transmitted by government and commercial organizations](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright#contributors), as well as collected during field studies by project participants..

OpenStreetMap is *Open Data*: you are free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit [OpenStreetMap and its contributors](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
