In the absence of a "consensus in the community" regarding the status of Crimea in OpenStreetMap, [Data Working Group](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Data_Working_Group) makes no effort to achieve it. On the contrary, numerous DWG actions on cutting off Crimea from Ukraine, when community members turn back the state of Ukraine's borders to widely international recognized states, do not represent a collective opinion, but only the inflamed imagination of a handful of individuals (for example, this set of changes is <https://openstreetmap.org/changeset/64786023>). Having super-rights, they block user accounts disagreeing with their decision. <sup>[[1]][62c5cdeb]</sup>
