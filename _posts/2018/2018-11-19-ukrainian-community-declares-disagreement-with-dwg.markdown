Ukrainian OpenStreetMap community is deeply disturbed after inspecting the recent decision of the Data Working Group concerning Crimea.

According to the resolution, Ukrainian borders should be reduced on the OpenStreetMap's map, and Crimean territory can no longer be included in Ukraine. DWG argues that Ukraine does not currently control Crimea:

> “Crimea shall be part of the Russia administrative relation and not the Ukraine one as long as Russia has on-the-ground control in Crimea.”

We as a community have to state that we do not agree with this decision and do not support it, as it presents a direct threat to the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. Borders of Ukraine are widely recognized internationally, including European Union, United Kingdom, USA, United Nations, NATO and other international organizations. In addition, this decision contradicts the principles of marking disputed territories as administative units as well as established practice of tagging similar territories (South Cyprus, Transnistria, Abkhazia etc). This decision puts using OSM data by the international community to danger if one considers the scope of sanctions imposed on persons and organizations responsible for annexation of Ukrainian territories or supporting said annexation.

Representatives of the Ukrainian community have filed an appeal to OpenStreetMap Foundation on this decision of the Data Working Group. We have addressed [MFA of Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/UkraineMFA), [Embassy of Ukraine to the UK](https://www.facebook.com/ukraine.in.uk/), [Qırımtatar Milliy Meclisi](https://www.facebook.com/meclis.org), Refat Chubarov (People's Deputy of Ukraine and leader of the Crimean Tatar national movement) asking them to use all lawful means to condemn this support of annexation and blatant disregard of the principles of international law.

OpenStreetMap data are being used by [Wikipedia](https://www.facebook.com/wikipedia/?), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/facebook/), [Apple](https://www.facebook.com/apple/), [Microsoft](https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft/), [United Nations](https://www.facebook.com/unitednations/), [World Bank](https://www.facebook.com/worldbank/), government institutions of different countries, businesses and Non-givernment organizations around the world. OpenStreetMap is important in the work of [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies](https://www.facebook.com/IFRC/), as it offers quick response to natural disasters by providing mapping for damaged territories. According to SimilarWeb, the site[openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) itself is visited by 10 million users monthly. On top of that, data from our project are being used independently by thousands of other services and information resources on the Internet. This resolution puts all of them at risk.

We hope to see wide support from Ukrainian community, as well as all the civilized world. Aggression and breaking the norms of international law should not be supported or tolerated. Join our call.
